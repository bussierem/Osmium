# Osmium

Osmium is intended to be a combination learning experience and new file explorer for me (and possibly others) to use.  My intent is to mimic the basics of any normal file explorer (and in the process learn more about how they work), and then add some stuff that I've felt is missing from the standard file explorers.

This is being written in Python, with Tkinter being used for the UI work.  My intent is to have a database of some kind eventually (not sure which one yet) to support certain features.

The current plan is to create the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to replicate the essentials of a file browser.  Once that is complete, I will be adding several features from my own personal wishlist.  After those are complete I will be taking requests on other possible features.

### Minimum Viable Product Features
These are the features that, when complete, will represent what I consider to be a "barebones file explorer".  This feature list will be sporadic in nature and varying in specificity - just things I think of as I code.
  - ~~Basic folder/file navigation~~
  - ~~File/etc Menu~~
    - **NOTE:** Not all of the menu options will be implemented in the MVP
  - ~~"URL" path navigation bar~~
  - ~~Buttons:~~
    - ~~Back~~
    - ~~Forward~~
    - ~~"Up One Level"~~
  - ~~Open files with default OS app~~
  - ~~Tree sidebar navigation~~
  - Bookmarks:
    - ~~Standard bookmarks (Desktop, Downloads, etc)~~
  - Search Bar
  - Icons for files/~~folders~~ in main view
  - Right-click menu

### Extra Features
These are features that I will only start looking at or considering after I have the aforementioned MVP completed.
  - "Tagging" of files/folders
  - Tabbed Navigation
    - Chrome-style shortcut keys for navigating tabs
  - Remove File Menu
    - Replace with F1 "Help" showing keyboard shortcuts
  - User created bookmarks
    -Make chrome-style bookmark bar??
